          Funding Black-led nonprofits is critical to bridging this immense gap
          as Black led nonprofits statistically put more resources into
          advancing racial justice than their white-led counterparts

          . But, racial bias is also deeply ingrained in philanthropic giving.
          Black-led organizations have 45 percent less revenue and 91 percent
          less unrestricted net assets than white-led organizations.
          Unrestricted funds are critical to nonprofit impact as it allows
          agency in how programming is designed and funds are allocated.

          Despite this, Black led nonprofits have demonstrated resolve,
          resiliency, and greater efficacy dollar per dollar in their
          programming. Endowing a social change nonprofit is one of
          philanthropyâ€™s purest expressions of power shifting4. It transfers
          some of the vast wealth of the few to the hands of the many. By
          putting wealth back under the control of frontline nonprofits and the
          communities they serve, we can give the best equipped organizations
          the financial certainty they need to deliver on their mission.
